# Recursive Fractions
> Like the project? Leave a star, it helps! ;)

**Release 0.3.0**

## Description
recfracs is an app that expands any rational (decimal) number into fraction form. It does not use the conventional method of division by powers of 10. It uses an entirely different and intuitive mathematical algorithm.

A few years ago, when I came up with this algorithm, I did not know much about programming nor github. This is now my attempt at making it known.


## Installation
### Get the app!
- Currently there is only the src/ folder with the basic script. You would need to setup the whole project in-order-to use it.


## Explanation
### How it works
- Maths happen.
